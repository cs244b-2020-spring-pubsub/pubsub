### Introduction
Publisher/Subscriber(Pub/Sub) is an asynchronous messaging-oriented service that serves as the backbone of contemporary distributed systems. In many cases it is used to decouple the functions of a massive monolithic application by aggregating multiple smaller yet more cohesive services. Being such a critical component to distributed systems, Pub/Sub services should also  be scalable so it could fit the requirement of the services that depend on it. 

Therefore, we propose this project that aims to replicate the functions of a pub/sub service with the capabilities to horizontally scale onto multiple machines to better serve the distributed systems it supports.
