### Repo
Pushing to `master` branch has been disabled by project owner. Please
keep all work in a forked repo and send pull request(PR) to make changes.
Code review is required and highly recommended.

### CI
Currently the project uses GitHub Actions to run all unit tests before
once a commit takes place.
